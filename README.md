# OverlayPNGScript-Python
 Overlay PNG Python Script

This script layers png images on top of each other and creates a final layered png file
The order of the image must be appended to the end of its name like so: SampleImage_1.png
An image with a lower order will apear behind an image with a higher order

Make sure to change the imageDir and saveDir parameters in the code
