# OverlayPNGScript-Python
 Overlay PNG Python Script

This script layers png images on top of each other and creates a final layered png file.
The order of the image must be appended to the end of its name like so: SampleImage_1.png.
An image with a lower order will apear behind an image with a higher order.

Make sure to change the parameters at the top in the code.
